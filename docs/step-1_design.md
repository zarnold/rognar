# Design

First thing is designing what I wanna do. In order to start coding I generally need three things :

- some description of what I want to acheive, sometimes called "User stories". This is an important part because it carries the purpose of want 
you want to do with your soft, being solving a problem or providing some entertainment.
- a basic UX, called wireframe. This is a basic sketch showing which elements are on the user interface.
 When starting I do not care about color chart, font or other graphical elements
- a description of the function provided by each element that appears on my design

Ok lets start with my game.

## User story

The purpose of this game is to talk with some strange creatures in order to find their secret. By talking with them you can "defeat" them, either by helping them or by driven them crazy.

Part of the game is finding the motivations and the failure of each of this creatures in order to find the rights words to either deliver or break them..

Exploring their deepest thought can be ease with skills. Skills will develop according to the path you take.

Yet, talking with nightmare creature is not without consequences and you can suffer negatives status that affect your own mind.

## UX Design

The UX is quite basic and functionnal here because I'm not an UX designer.
I just put the element I think I need for my game. There are :

- the main  window. It displays a background and the creature portrait
- a text part that display the text said by the creature ( note that there is no scroll to past text yet.)
- a window with the choice offered to the player. Obviously clicking on a link has some effect and lead to another part of the dialogue tree
- a window with info about the player among others the current skills and the current status

Seems enough for a basic game.
